                <p>
                    Hello ! I graduated for Air Traffic Control but decided I wanted to get into programming. I've sort of told myself it was too late 
                    to switch to learning something new half way into college but I ultimately decided I wanted to do something I would enjoy for the rest of my life.
                    I'm currently enrolled in a bootcamp for web development but I would also like to try exploring the possibilites of data analytics.
                </p>
