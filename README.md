# Description
Made a portfolio using html and CSS to help myself in the future look for a career. I build this portfolio as a template for a future portfolio once I get more expierenced. It was my first time building a website from scratch so It was a bit challenging.

# UPDATE 
Updated Portfolio to include a project I've done in a group. Made minor adjustments like making the navbar fixed instead of sticky and changing how my images look on site. I want to add more detailed backgrounds such as actual images and sub pages within the website instead of it just being one page.

# UPDATE 2 
Added Bootstrap.
Added another project and took out fill in projects
Planning on adding routes to make seperate pages potentially for different things such as My Work. Wasn't able to inmplement it yet because I'm currently 5 homework behind :(
